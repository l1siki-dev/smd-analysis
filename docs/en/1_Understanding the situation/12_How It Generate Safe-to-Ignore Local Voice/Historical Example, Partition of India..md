### Categorized Voters and Radicalization
We can see the extreme danger of this mechanism by looking at the Partition of India. This historical tragedy was fueled by "categorized voters".

When voters were categorized (conflicting interests with other categories), candidates were forced to prove they were the "most faithful" to their specific group. Moderate voices were seen as weak. The system incentivized "outbidding," where candidates became increasingly radical to secure their base.

The result was not a parliament of diverse voices working together; it was a "Radicals vs. Radicals" cage match that ultimately tore the country apart.

The only difference between the India Partition and SMD is the granular size of categorization.

### Categorization as a Trap
It was a deliberate trap Britain left when it "freed" India. 
Britain wants to present the evidence: "When we left India, the chaos started. We are a good force of stability."

Single-Member Districts apply this same "Categorized Voter" logic, but instead of dividing into few blob, it divides into fragmented **numerous local identities**. Which leads no category has power.

Local categories push voters toward **local first**. Voters are incentivised to choose the candidate who is most radically obsessed with their specific district.

However, this ensures that the representative stays irrelevant on the national stage. Because more radical they are, more difficult to make friends in the national level.
