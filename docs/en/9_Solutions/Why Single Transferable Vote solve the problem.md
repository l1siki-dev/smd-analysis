### 1. Solves "Small Party Loses Before Vote" (The Cost of Entry)
*   **The Mechanism:** Instead of 100 small districts, we combine them into fewer, larger "Multi-Member Districts" (electing 3–5 people).
*   **The Fix:** A party no longer needs enough money to fight 100 individual battles. They don't need 51% of the vote to win; they only need about 15–20% (the "quota") to win *one* of the five seats.
*   **Result:** Diversity of thought is mathematically guaranteed without requiring massive capital.

### 2. Solves "Radicalization" (The Cooperation Incentive)
*   **The Mechanism:** Voters don't just pick one winner; they **Rank** candidates (1, 2, 3...). If your #1 choice loses, your vote *transfers* to your #2.
*   **The Fix:** This destroys the "Divide and Conquer" strategy. To win, a candidate often needs "transfer votes" from other parties. If a candidate is radical or attacks their neighbors, they get zero transfer votes and lose.
*   **Result:** Politicians are forced to compete on being the "most acceptable," not the "most loud."

### 3. Solves "Categorization is Manipulation" (Gerrymandering)
*   **The Mechanism:** Moving lines matters when it is "Winner Take All." In STV, the district reflects the *proportions* of the people inside it.
*   **The Fix:** You cannot "crack" or "pack" voters easily because 5 seats will naturally capture both the majority and the minority view within that shape.
*   **Result:** The precise location of the border stops mattering. The power returns to the voter, not the map-maker.

### 4. Solves "The Trap of the Local Hero"
*   **The Mechanism:** You vote for a person, not a party list, but within a larger region.
*   **The Fix:** The representative is still local enough to be accountable, but their district is large enough that they must campaign on **National Issues**, not just local "pork barrel" promises.
*   **Result:** Representatives go to parliament with a mandate for policy, not just a mandate to fix local potholes.
