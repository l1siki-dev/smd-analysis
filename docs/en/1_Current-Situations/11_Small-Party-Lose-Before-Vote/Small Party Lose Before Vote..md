### The Scenario: 100 Districts

- **The "Evil Party" (Rich/Unpopular):** They are rich since they are corrupted. They have money to send **100 candidates**. They can afford the registration fees, staff, and advertising for every single district.
    
- **The "Good Party" (Poor/Popular):** They only have enough funding to field **10 candidates**. Having the better idea. Having support from voters. But, they are absent from 90% of the map.

### The Math of "Victory by Default."

Under SMD rules, if only one person runs in a district, they win automatically.

- **In 90 Districts:** The Evil Party win automatically. Even if people don't support them,
    
- **In 10 Districts:** The Good Party wins all 10 seats, because voters support them. Their win rate is 100%.
### The Result

| **Party**      | **Candidates** | **Popular Support**  | **Seats Won** | **Power**      |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Evil Party** | 100            | Near Zero            | **90**        | Absolute       |
| **Good Party** | 10             | 100% (where present) | **10**        | Zero Influence |

### The Verdict: This system reward big party (money).

Having good ideas is not the most important factor.
Voters' support become optional. The real victory condition is "send more candidate than other parties", which means spend more money.
This system is Anti-Democracy by design.
