## The Scenario: 100 Districts

- **The "Evil Party" (Rich/Unpopular):** They are rich since they are corrupted. They have money to send **100 candidates**. They can afford the registration fees, staff, and advertising for every single district.
    
- **The "Good Party" (Poor/Popular):** They only have enough funding to field **10 candidates**. Having better ideas. Having support from voters. 

### The Math of "Victory by Default."

Under SMD, if no one from the party runs in a district, they lose automatically.

- **In 90 Districts:** The Good Party lose automatically. Even if people support them,
    
- **In 10 Districts:** The Good Party wins all 10 seats, because voters support them. Their actual win rate is 100%.
### The Result

| **Party**      | **Candidates** | **Popular Support**  | **Seats Won** | **Power**      |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
| **Evil Party** | 100            | Near Zero            | **90**        | Absolute       |
| **Good Party** | 10             | 100% (where present) | **10**        | Zero Influence |

### The Verdict: This system rewards big parties (money).

Having support from people is not the most important factor.
Voters' support becomes optional. The real victory condition is "send more candidates than other parties", which means spending more money.
This system is Anti-Democracy by design.
