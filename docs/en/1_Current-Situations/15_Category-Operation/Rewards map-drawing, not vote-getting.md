For example, the famous Gerrymandering (the way to manipulate election results by manipulating geographical categorization threashould) is only possible because of "Categorization of voters."

These manipulations are possible because they have the category to tinker. Without category, no manipulation.

Introducing any categorized voters, even with good intent, will result fragile election system that is prone to being manipulated.

The existence of categorized voters incentivises politicians to manipulate votes by changing how they are categorized. Because a politician's survival depends on the election result.

### Verdict: Any Categorized Voters System incentives bad actions.
No matter the intention. 
When we **need to** categorize voters, for technical reasons, the effect should be minimized. The common implementation of "Winner Takes All" with categorized voting is a deliberate exploit to maximize the flaw of the mechanism to maximize a politician's survival.
Politicians have a strong incentive to manipulate votes to survive. It's too dangerous to let them draw rule for the election.
