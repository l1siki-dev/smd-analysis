2. Because the current system is not good for you. It is often designed for politicians' survival. Not your survival.
3. Because if we demand the change, politicians have to implement the change. We can change the outcome. If we acknowledge the current situation and act.

5. Because we should act things become too late. Elites are re-shaping internet for them. And AI could be something so powerful and we are living in possibly the most important era of humanity. What decided today could persist incledible long time and affect so many people.
