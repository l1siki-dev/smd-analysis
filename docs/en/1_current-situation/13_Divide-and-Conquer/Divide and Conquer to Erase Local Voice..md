[](../../non-mkdocs/13/Big%20Parties%20Gain,%20Voters%20Lose..md)Single-Member Districts (SMD) are frequently advertised as: **"Delivers the local voice to parliament.** Having one representative for each geographic area means that the specific community gets a dedicated champion."

But, is that true?
### 1. The Trap of the "Local Hero"
Imagine you are a voter in "Awesome City." You have two candidates:

*   **Candidate A:** "I will make the whole country prosperous. To achieve it, Awesome City may sometimes have to compromise or pay more."
*   **Candidate B:** "I will make Awesome City great."

Which do you choose?
Most people will choose **Candidate B**. They vote for the "Local Hero" who promises them benefits.
### 2. Local Hero become Invisible on National Level
Here lies the systemic failure. When Candidate B (the Local Hero) enters parliament, they become invisible.

Parliament is comprised of hundreds of big party members and a handful of other "Local Heroes" from a different city. None of them has any incentive to help Awesome City; in fact, they are incentivized to take resources *away* from Awesome City to help their own promise to the people.

Because the Local Hero promised "Awesome City First", they can't make friends. The "Local Voice" will be ignored because the system ensure will not have influence.



#### Conclusion: Divide and Conquer
Single-Member Districts do not amplify the local voice; they isolate and erase it. By forcing politicians to act as neighborhood guardians to win local election, system ensure that politician will be ignored in national level. The system ensures that every locality remains structurally powerless. 

This is a classic Divide and Conquer strategy applied on democracy system.
