### Democratic G20 Countries: Winner-Take-All SMD Systems

  

| Country | Use or not | How it's impactful (High to low) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **United States** | **Use** | **High** | Pure SMD (First-Past-The-Post). The most "Winner-Take-All" major democracy. |
| **United Kingdom** | **Use** | **High** | Pure SMD (First-Past-The-Post). Often results in "landslide" majorities for one party. |
| **Canada** | **Use** | **High** | Pure SMD (First-Past-The-Post). Locally, second place gets zero representation. |
| **India** | **Use** | **High** | Pure SMD (First-Past-The-Post). Large-scale use of winner-take-all to ensure local accountability. |
| **France** | **Use** | **High** | Two-Round SMD. Only one winner per district, but uses runoffs to ensure the winner has broad support. |
| **Australia** | **Use** | **High** | SMD with Ranked-Choice. Still one winner per district, but "Winner-Take-All" is decided by preferences. |
| **Japan** | **Use** | **Medium-High** | **Mixed (Parallel)**. 289 seats are strictly winner-take-all. Losing here doesn't affect the party's proportional seats. |
| **Mexico** | **Use** | **Medium-High** | **Mixed (Parallel)**. 300 seats are elected via winner-take-all districts; 200 are proportional. |
| **South Korea** | **Use** | **Medium-High** | **Mixed (Parallel)**. Similar to Japan; the district seats are independent winner-take-all contests. |
| **Germany** | **Use** | **Medium-Low** | **Mixed (MMP)**. While local candidates win their seats via winner-take-all, the *total* power of a party is corrected by the proportional vote. |
| **Italy** | **Use** | **Low** | **Mixed**. About 1/3 of seats are winner-take-all; the rest are proportional, diluting the local "winner" effect. |

  

### Why "Impact" Varies:

  

* **High Impact:** These are "Pure" systems. If your party gets 20% of the vote nationwide but doesn't win a single district, you get **zero** seats in parliament.

* **Medium Impact (Japan/Mexico/Korea):** These are **Parallel Systems**. The winner-take-all districts and the proportional lists exist side-by-side. The proportional seats *do not* compensate for losses in the districts.

* **Medium-Low Impact (Germany):** This is a **Compensatory System**. Even if a candidate wins a district (Winner-Take-All), if their party did poorly overall, the system adds seats for other parties to make the final parliament reflect the national vote. The "Winner-Take-All" aspect is mostly used to decide *which individuals* from a party get to sit in the chairs.
