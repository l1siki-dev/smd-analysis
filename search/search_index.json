Impact on the result Notes United States \u2705 Heighest Pure SMD (First-Past-The-Post). The most \"Winner-Take-All\" major democracy. United Kingdom \u2705 High Pure SMD (First-Past-The-Post). Often results in \"landslide\" majorities for one party. Canada \u2705 High Pure SMD (First-Past-The-Post). Locally, second place gets zero representation. India \u2705 High Pure SMD (First-Past-The-Post). Large-scale use of winner-take-all to ensure local accountability. France \u2705 Medium-High Two-Round SMD. Only one winner per district, but use runoffs to ensure the winner has broad support. Australia \u2705 Medium-High SMD with Ranked-Choice. Still one winner per district, but \"Winner-Take-All\" is decided by preferences. Japan \u2705 Medium Mixed (Parallel). 289 seats are strictly winner-take-all. Losing here doesn't affect the party's proportional seats. Mexico \u2705 Medium Mixed (Parallel). 300 seats are elected via winner-take-all districts; 200 are proportional. South Korea \u2705 Medium Mixed (Parallel). Similar to Japan; the district seats are independent winner-take-all contests. Germany \u2705 Low Mixed (MMP). While local candidates win their seats via winner-take-all, the total power of a party is corrected by the proportional vote. Italy \u2705 Low Mixed. About 1/3 of seats are winner-take-all; the rest are proportional, diluting the local \"winner\" effect. ### Why \"Impact\" Varies: * High Impact: These are \"Pure\" systems. If your party gets 20% of the vote nationwide but doesn't win a single district, you get zero seats in parliament. * Medium Impact (Japan/Mexico/Korea): These are Parallel Systems. The winner-take-all districts and the proportional lists exist side-by-side. The proportional seats do not compensate for losses in the districts. * Medium-Low Impact (Germany): This is a Compensatory System. Even if a candidate wins a district (Winner-Take-All), if their party did poorly overall, the system adds seats for other parties to make the final parliament reflect the national vote. The \"Winner-Take-All\" aspect is mostly used to decide which individuals from a party get to sit in the chairs."},{"location":"1_Current-Situations/11_Filter-by-money%2C-not-popularity/Filter%20by%20money%2C%20not%20popularity/","title":"Filter By Money, Not Popularity","text":"<p>\u23f1\ufe0f Read time: ~1 min (224 Words)</p>"},{"location":"1_Current-Situations/11_Filter-by-money%2C-not-popularity/Filter%20by%20money%2C%20not%20popularity/#the-scenario-100-districts","title":"The Scenario: 100 Districts","text":"<ul> <li> <p>The \"Evil Party\" (Rich/Unpopular): They are rich since they are corrupted.
